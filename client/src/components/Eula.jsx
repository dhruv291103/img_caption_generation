        please contact us and we will help you out as soon as we can.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Software Licensing Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legally binding
        contract between you (hereinafter referred to as "You" or "Licensee")
        and Bergside Inc. ("Licensor"). By accessing or using Flowbite Pro,
        including any downloadable files, HTML source code snippets, and Figma
        assets provided to you upon purchase (collectively, the "Software"), you
        acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by
        the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree with
        these terms, do not use the Software.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
      <p>
        Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        revocable license to use the Software.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>2. Licensing Options</h2>
      <h3>Standard License</h3>
      <p>
        The Standard License is designed for individual use and offers a
        versatile option for creators. While it is intended for single-user
        access, it serves as an excellent choice for those seeking to build an
        unlimited number of projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're developing personal websites, crafting web applications
        for clients, creating commercial software, or working on open-source
        initiatives, the Standard License provides the flexibility and tools you
        need to bring your ideas to life. It empowers you to utilize the
        download files for a wide range of projects, making it an ideal choice
        for individual developers and small teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        This license grants permission to one individual (the Licensee) to
        access and use the download files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of allowed usage include creating personal websites, web
        applications for clients, commercial SaaS applications, self-hosted web
        applications, and open-source projects where the primary purpose is not
        redistributing download files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of disallowed usage include creating repositories of Flowbite
        Pro elements for public distribution, developing alternative versions of
        Flowbite Pro, and creating website builder projects that can be
        considered as direct competitors of Flowbite Pro.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Team License</h3>
      <p>
        This license extends permission to up to ten (10) Employees and
        Contractors of the Licensee's organization to access and use the
        download files. Usage by additional team members beyond this limit
        requires a separate licensing agreement (ie. a new purchase of a Team
        License) or an appropriate upgrade.
      </p>
      <p>
        This license grants the same permissions and restrictions as the
        Standard License, with the added benefit of accommodating larger teams
        within the specified limit. The same usage examples and prohibitions as
        outlined in the Standard License apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please ensure that your organization adheres to the specified team
        member limit. If you require licensing for more than ten team members,
        please contact us for further licensing options.
      </p>
